Did you start your function definition with def?
Does your function name have only characters and _ (underscore) characters?
Did you put an open parenthesis ( right after the function name?
Did you put your arguments after the parenthesis ( separated by commas?
Did you make each argument unique (meaning no duplicated names)?
Did you put a close parenthesis and a colon ): after the arguments?
Did you indent all lines of code you want in the function four spaces? No more, no less.
Did you "end" your function by going back to writing with no indent (dedenting we call it)?
