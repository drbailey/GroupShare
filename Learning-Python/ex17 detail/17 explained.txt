EXERCISE 17: MORE FILES
The basic idea here is copy one file's contents to another. The author uses some questionable notation, but he opens two files, checks if the write file exists, then lets the user choose whether or not to proceed, he then closes the files. 
 - 17.py is exactly what the exercise has written.
 - 17(commented).py has more details.
 - 17 - drill 1.py is drill one.
 - 17 - drill 1(commented).py includes more details.
 - 17 - drill 2.py is drill two.
 - 17 - drill 2(commented).py includes more details.
Read through the comments in the commented files to see what I did and what I was thinking.

Some notes finish with:
 - Generally scripts that I run are not run through the command line so argv is not very useful. (Use os.getcwd() to get directory).
 - I stopped after drill two since they seemed less relevant.


how to run from windows:
